      Another brilliant long-haul destination with one of the world's most
      beautiful lakes is Bolivia. This shallow salt lake, known in English as
      the Red Lagoon, is considered one of the country's most incredible natural
      wonders. The lake is only one metre deep and gets its distinctive colour
      from red sediment and algae.

      One of its main attractions is the flocks of colourful flamingos that
      feast on the plankton in the lake during the summer months. The red algae
      in Laguna Colorada keeps their feathers a wonderfully vibrant pink and
      it's a joy to see them carefully wading through the water, reflected in
      its calm surface. The lake is a photographer's paradise, with a backdrop
      of snowcapped mountains and volcanos creating stunning vistas.
