      The surrounding Dolomites are perfect for exploring by train, with several
      historic rail lines running through the peaks and offering some
      jaw-dropping views out across the lake. You'll get to traverse the
      mountains by train, cable car, and funicular railway on Country Living's
      eight-day holiday where you'll be based at a beautiful lakefront hotel on
      Lake Molveno.
