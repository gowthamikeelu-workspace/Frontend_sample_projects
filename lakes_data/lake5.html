      Another of northern Italy's most charming lakes is the lovely Lake
      Maggiore, located on the border of Italy and Switzerland on the south side
      of the Alps. It's Italy's second-largest lake, and its tranquil shores are
      lined with fragrant oleanders and palms, dotted by classic belle époque
      hotels set against the backdrop of snowcapped peaks.

      The real jewel of the lake is its gorgeous Isola Bella, a tiny islet taken
      up almost entirely by a magnificent Baroque palace and terraced gardens
      that slope down to the lake's shores. You'll visit Lake Maggiore as part
      of Country Living's eight-day tour of northern Italy, stopping in Stresa,
      one of the finest resort towns on the lake's banks.
