      We're spoilt for choice when it comes to great lakes in Europe, but if
      you're hoping for a long-haul adventure you'll find some truly spectacular
      lakes and peaks in the famous Canadian Rockies. Lake Louise, in Banff
      National Park, is known and loved for its vivid turquoise waters and its
      majestic backdrop of the Victoria Glacier.
