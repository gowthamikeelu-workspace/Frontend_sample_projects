      Nestled among the pretty peaks of the Julian Alps and the Karavanke
      Mountains, Lake Bled is a famous symbol of Slovenia's natural beauty.
      Visitors can explore the tranquil glacial lake by taking a leisurely
      two-hour walk around its shores. Or, if you feel like taking to the water,
      you can hire a traditional flat-bottomed wooden boat known as a pletna, to
      gently glide across the lake's calm waters.
