      You're not limited to warm weather destinations when it comes to lake
      holidays. One of the most beautiful lakes in Iceland is the fabulous
      Jökulsárlón, a glacial lagoon with otherworldly black, volcanic sands and
      a beach known as "diamond beach" because of the glistening chunks of ice
      dotted on the sand.

      Seeing the lake's jaw-dropping ice-bergs up close is an unmissable
      experience for any nature lover. Those looking to get a close look at
      Iceland's icebergs can take a boat tour to see them up close, and keep an
      eye out for seals in the bobbing in the lagoon or resting on the ice
      bergs. While on a boat trip you might also spot seals bobbing in the icy
      water or resting on the floating ice bergs.
