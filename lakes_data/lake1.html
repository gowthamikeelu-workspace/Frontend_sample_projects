        Lakeside living is the epitome of la dolce vita in Italy, and it's no
        wonder its glamorous lakes are a magnet for the rich and famous. Lake
        Garda is the country's largest, stretching from Milan and Brescia to the
        west and Verona and Venice to the east. Taking a driving tour around the
        whole lake is a great way to discover the quaint towns dotted along its
        shores, nestled among Mediterranean flora of citrus trees and cypresses.

        You'll find some exquisite villa-style hotels dotting along the
        lakefront, where you can simply relax and soak in the views or venture
        out to explore Garda's enchanting towns. You'll be staying in a classic
        villa hotel on the lake shores on Country Living's seven-night tour of
        northern Italy - the perfect base for exploring the surrounding area.
