      Despite its name, the Dead Sea is in fact a vast saltwater lake in
      southwestern Asia. The lake has huge historical significance; the
      Egyptians used the lake for mummification and the Romans valued it for its
      salt supplies. It was also one of the world's very first health resorts,
      and visitors have been flocking there for thousands of years.

      Today you can still reap the health benefits of the Dead Sea with a stay
      on the Jordanian banks of this historic lake. The minerals in the water
      are known to nourish and rejuvenate the skin and can also ease arthritis
      and rheumatism because of their detoxifying properties. Even if you have
      no health complaints, floating on the dense water and enjoying views of
      mountainous desert landscapes is a wonderfully peaceful experience.
